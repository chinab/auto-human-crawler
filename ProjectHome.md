If you have a need to crawl a page or a set of pages,
without being detected as a crawler, or a bot, you are at the right place --

auto-human-crawler as the name suggests aims to be an automated crawler,
that cannot be distinguished from a real human being.

This will be a java library, built over http client, and will also handle
javascript at some point, to avoid the detection as a machine.
